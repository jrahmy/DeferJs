Defer JS
========
This add-on **collects javascript** in post-view output and **moves them to the
bottom of the page**. This has a noticeable impact on page-load times as pending
HTTP requests postpone rendering of a page.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage
-----
1. Upload the add-on to your XenForo installation
2. Install the add-on XML via the Administration Control Panel

**If you have any scripts in IE conditionals, you must blacklist them!**
